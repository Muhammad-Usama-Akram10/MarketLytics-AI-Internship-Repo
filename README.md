# Road Accident Dashboard Project
# Project Details
## Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard using a real-world dataset.  
The aim is to analyze accident patterns based on different factors like weather conditions, road types, driver experience, vehicle movement, and more.  
The dashboard provides quick insights for better decision-making and public safety awareness.

## Features

### Visualizations
- Type of Collision by Weather Condition
- Cause of Accident by Road Surface Type
- Sum of Accident Severity by Driving Experience
- Sum of Accident Severity by Vehicle Movement
- Types of Junctions Involved

### Interactive Filters
- Filter by Age Band of Drivers
- Filter by Driving Experience

### Aggregated Metrics
- Accident counts
- Severity sums

### User-friendly Layout
- Easy-to-read graphs and charts
- Organized data presentation

## Outcome
- Created a clear and interactive dashboard for accident analysis.
- Helped to identify major causes of accidents based on environmental and human factors.
- Made it easier for users to understand accident trends at a glance.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX**: For advanced calculations and metrics.
- **Excel**: For data cleaning.

## Future Enhancements
- Add real-time data updates if connected to an online source.
- Integrate machine learning to predict accident probabilities.
- Improve the dashboard with geographical maps showing accident hotspots.
- Add an email alert system for critical accident pattern detections.
